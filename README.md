# VaccinationApi
A Vaccination API with the main entities: persons, health_professionals, vaccines, vaccinations, and health_centers. 
This project simulates a system for applying and storing information about vaccinations. For this, we have two roles: persons and health_professionals, each one with your own authentication rules and permission levels. The technology used to implement this was [Guardian](https://hexdocs.pm/guardian/Guardian.html). <br/>
One faced challenge was implementing the processing of many vaccinations simultaneously because not handling this case could crash the database. For this, [Oban](https://hexdocs.pm/oban/Oban.html) was used, a flexible library that can handle a wide range of background jobs.

# TO DO
- [ ] Implement the roles and permissions system for Admin, Persons and Health Professionals
- [ ] Secure endpoints with permission levels
- [ ] Create an endpoint to validate vaccination token
- [ ] Manage vaccine stock at the Health Center when register a vaccination (decrease stock)
- [ ] Check if the Health Center has sufficient stock of the vaccine before registering a vaccination 
- [ ] Verify if the health professional works at the health center before registering the vaccination.
- [ ] Include Address entity and relationships
